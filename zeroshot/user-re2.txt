You are given a list of possible classification labels:
```json
{{ labels }}
```
Your task is to determine the most appropriate class for the following article based on its title, abstract, and keywords:
```json
{{ plot }}
```
The preliminary classification results for this article is provided below:
```
json
{{ previous }}

Follow these steps:
Read the article (title, abstract, keywords).
Compare its main topics and methods to the label definitions above.
Check whether the preliminary label is correct; if not, propose a correction and say why.
Provide a brief, concrete justification for your final choice (no internal chain-of-thought).
Return the result in the JSON format shown below.

Only if none of the labels from the first list seem suitable, try to find an appropriate label from this secondary list:
```json
{{ labels2 }}
```
