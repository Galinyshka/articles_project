You are given a list of possible classification labels:

```json
{{ labels }}
```

The label `"None"` should be selected only when there is insufficient information to confidently assign the article to any of the other classes.

Your task is to determine the most appropriate class for the following article, based on its title, abstract, and keywords:

```json
{{ plot }}
```

Start by providing a detailed chain of thought explaining how you evaluate the article content against the list of classes. Consider what features or keywords suggest inclusion or exclusion from specific categories.

Based on your reasoning, assign the most suitable class from the list.

   * If no class fits the article due to lack of sufficient information, select "None".
