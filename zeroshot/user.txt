You are given a list of possible classification labels:

```json
{{ labels }}
```
Your task is to determine the most appropriate class for the following article based on its provided content (title, abstract, and keywords):
```json
{{ plot }}
```

Follow these steps:

1. Carefully analyze the title, abstract, and keywords.
2. Identify salient topics, methods, domains, target population, and named entities from the text.
3. Compare these features against each candidate label and decide which label best matches the article content.
4. Provide a concise and transparent justification. Include a short summary of the main reasons and a list of explicit text excerpts or keywords used as evidence.
5. Select exactly one label from the provided labels. Only choose "None" when the title, abstract, and keywords lack sufficient information (e.g., missing key details, vague descriptions, or irrelevant content) to confidently assign any given label. Clearly explain why the information is insufficient.
