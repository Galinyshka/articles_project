You are given a list of possible classification labels:

```json
{{ labels }}
```
Your task is to determine the most appropriate class for the following article based on its provided content (title, abstract, and keywords):
```json
{{ plot }}
```

Follow these steps:
Read the article (title, abstract, keywords).
Compare its main topics and methods to the label definitions above.
Check whether the preliminary label is correct; if not, propose a correction and say why.
Provide a brief, concrete justification for your final choice (no internal chain-of-thought).
Return the result in the JSON format shown below.

If none of the labels from the first list seem suitable, try to find an appropriate label from this secondary list:
```json
{{ labels2 }}
```
